# Speak-Up-Web

* Due to this pandemic situation, Public can’t go to the respective offices and file their complaint so, we came up with the idea of developing a web application so that public can complaint their problems from their homes. We also included that public can also get information from the government officials like ‘This area will have a shutdown on Saturday – from Electricity sector’. 

* It will be very useful for the public. If a public filed a complaint the complaint list in the government official’s page can be deleted only if the complaint’s conformation status is marked as solved by both public and government officials otherwise it will always appear on the list. 

* Public can be able to view the status of their complaint whether it is ‘Acknowledged’ or ‘Marked as solved by Government officials’. 

* The admin can also view the registered government official details and also the complaints filed by the public. The admin also can’t able to delete the complaints filed by the public if it is not marked as solved by both government official and public. Admin can move the filed complaint to the higher officials if the complaint is not solved by the government officials within 3 days.
